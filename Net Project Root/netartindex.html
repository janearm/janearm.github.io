The abstract collages were based off of dadaist poems that were created through scrambling various newspaper articles and finding a composition of around eight words that form a poem. I randomly selected three news articles from three different publications: The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and a paper that is local to my hometown, The Greenville News Journal. I didnâ€™t pay much attention to the content of the articles as I thought the more random they were the more interesting my poem would be. After the scrambling process, I came up with the poem: Now received life, had a response, the drone of vitality of intuition. After creating a library of over 20 images I created several compositions based on what my poem means to me. As each page is explored more layers of meaning will be revealed. Good luck! </h2>
